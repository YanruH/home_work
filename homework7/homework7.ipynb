Assume that all subsets are selected uniformly, order doesn't matter, and you can only generate subsets for letters (don't include the $|$). For the example given above, if I=2, the complete sample space would be:\n",

    "You've just been hired by Tesla! Your first job is to create a new python type that is capable of introspecting the most important part of the car - the battery!. Create this new python type so that when a battery is created it has 100% power. It's likely that power will change a lot over time, so make sure that the way in which the battery power is set and get is capable of being changed without having to change the api."

    "1. Your first job with the `Car` type is to create a method called `draw`. This method should create an iterator that decrements the battery's power by 1 each time it is called. Go ahead and instantiate this iterator every time a Car type is built.  \n",

    "\n",
    "2. Second, create a method called `throttle`. Each time throttle is called it returns the current power of the battery by executing next on the iterator built from `draw`."
